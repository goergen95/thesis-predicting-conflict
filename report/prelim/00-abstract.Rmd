# Abstract {-}

Violent conflicts endanger human lives, the social cohesion of societies 
and the natural environment. While the number of intensive international conflicts 
has remained on a low level during the 21st century, civil wars are on the rise. 
Since the 1990s, research engages in predicting the outbreak of violence. However, 
findings on the role the natural environment plays in the emergence of 
violence remain mostly inconclusive. In order to contribute to the discussion this
thesis sets out to compare the predictive performance of deep learning models using 
data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) on civil conflict between 2001 to 2019.
The data is simultaneously aggregated on administrative districts and sub-basin watersheds 
and combined with socio-economic and environmental predictors. The hyperparameters 
of CNN-LSTM architectures are optimized employing a Bayesian Optimization strategy. 
The results in terms of $F_2$-score suggest significant improvements for aggregating 
predictors on sub-basin watersheds ($+7.16,p=3.4e^{-11}$) as well as integrating 
environmental predictors ($+3.98,p=5.9e^{-05})$ for a combined conflict class. For 
other conflict classes, the results tend to the same direction but are not significant. 
Through the comparison to existing conflict prediction tools, the thesis exposes 
the sensitivity of prediction models to spatial scale and units of aggregation. 
It is argued that in order to fulfill the requirements of effective conflict 
prevention efforts, prediction research will have to fully integrate modern deep 
learning frameworks and constant data streams on different earth processes in the future.
